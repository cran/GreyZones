Description: Grey zones locally occur in an agreement table due to the subjective evaluation of raters based on various factors such as not having uniform guidelines, the differences between the raters' level of expertise or low variability among the level of the categorical variable. It is important to detect grey zones since they cause a negative bias in the estimate of the agreement level. This package provides a function for detecting the existence of grey zones in two-way inter-rater agreement tables (Demirhan and Yilmaz (2023) <doi:10.1186/s12874-022-01759-7>).
